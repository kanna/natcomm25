\subsection{Abstract}

This work demonstrates the viability of coupling ocean models with in
situ robotic sampling in the context of a dynamic coastal region as a
means to increase model skill and prediction. Model driven exploration
then is a means to close such a
\emph{sample-assimilate-predict-direct} loop within a virtuous cycle
to refine prediction for a range of applications in a region which is
often harsh, has high variability and interaction with a range of
physical forcings including the bathymetry and coastal topography.
