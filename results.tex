\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}

Fig. \ref{fig:sst} summarizes environmental conditions observed during
the three-day experimental window considered in this study. The
background fields correspond to the Level-3 Sea Surface Temperature
(SST) product from CMS. The operational area covers approximately 100
km\textsuperscript{2} south of the \naz Canyon. While all missions
focused on temperature variability predicted by the model, on
31\textsuperscript{st} October XP2 was deployed for a cross-shore
transect of approximately 13 km to sample an internal-wave hotspot; in
this study, it serves as an independent ground-truth dataset. These
observations are used as a reference for evaluating the forecast cases
\textbf{C1–-C4} and \textbf{D1–-D4}.

During the experimentation, the coastal ocean was influenced by a
late-season upwelling-relaxation cycle. At the beginning of the
sequence (29\textsuperscript{th}), the SST field reveals the
characteristic signature of coastal upwelling, with colder water
masses extending offshore due to wind-driven Ekman transport that
brings subsurface, nutrient-rich waters to the surface. In the
following days, the weakening of upwelling-favorable winds led to a
relaxation phase, during which warmer offshore waters gradually
advanced toward the coast. This transition is reflected in the SST
maps by an overall warming trend in the nearshore region, particularly
evident on November 1\textsuperscript{st} (Fig. \ref{fig:sst}).

It is important to note that the SST imagery is partially affected by
cloud coverage, which limits the availability and accuracy of
satellite-derived temperature data. Despite these limitations, the SST
patterns clearly capture the dominant mesoscale features and coastal
processes driving the observed variability during the experiment.  The
pronounced temperature gradients associated with the upwelling front
generated well-defined spatial and temporal variability, making the
impact of targeted in-situ observations on predictive model skill
visible.

Fig.\ref{fig:temperatureprofiles} shows the vertical temperature
distribution measured by the AUVs between the 29\textsuperscript{th}
and the 31\textsuperscript{st}. The panels illustrate the temporal and
vertical structure of the coastal water column throughout the
three-day period, as well as highlighting the non-linear nature of
logistics in multi-vehicle operations, where scheduling, resources,
and environmental constraints together determine the actual temporal
coverage of the vehicles.

XP2 operated on the 29\textsuperscript{th}, XP5 on the
29\textsuperscript{th}, 30\textsuperscript{th}, and
31\textsuperscript{st}, and XP3 on 30\textsuperscript{th} and
31\textsuperscript{st} October.  The temperature fields reveal a
thermocline and a progressive warming of the surface layer down to
approximately 40m depth, with temperatures ranging from around
14$^{\circ}$C in deeper layers to about 18$^{\circ}$C near the
surface, reaching their maximum on the 30\textsuperscript{th}
afternoon during XP5’s mission.


In Fig. \ref{fig:scatter}, four scatter plots compare the measurements
acquired in-situ on the 31\textsuperscript{st} against the
corresponding geostatistical predictions derived under each
scenario. They focus on the most contrasted scenarios: the baseline
cases without assimilation (\textbf{C} and \textbf{D}) and those
incorporating the full set of AUV observations from previous days
(\textbf{C4} and \textbf{D4}). The observations include all available
data collected by the missions on that day (see Fig. \ref{fig:sst} and
\ref{fig:temperatureprofiles}). Colors indicate the depth layers
associated with the vertical discretization used in the CMS model
which defines the vertical structure of the statistical model.  This
comparison illustrates the statistical model's ability to reproduce
the observed temperatures at each measurement point accurately,
contrasting the non-assimilated cases (\textbf{C} and \textbf{D}) with
the partially and fully assimilated (\textbf{C1–4} and \textbf{D1–4}).

In the baseline scenarios without assimilation (\textbf{C} and
\textbf{D}), the plots exhibit a wide spread of points around the
reference line, indicating substantial discrepancies between the model
predictions and the observed AUV measurements. These deviations are
particularly evident in XP3 and XP5 data, where temperatures around
20--30 m depth tend to be overestimated by almost 1$^{\circ}$C)
(Figs. \ref{fig:rms_c} and \ref{fig:rms_d}). This dispersion reflects
the model’s limited ability to accurately reproduce the vertical
thermal structure when it relies solely on CMS data without
incorporating in-situ information.

In contrast, the fully assimilated scenarios (\textbf{C4} and
\textbf{D4}) show a much tighter clustering of points around the
reference, especially within the studied upper layers, where the
previous AUV missions provide dense and temporally relevant
observations. This reduction in spread suggests a clear improvement in
predictive accuracy, indicating that the assimilation of targeted
measurements effectively constrains the thermal structure and captures
ongoing physical transitions in the water column.

Figs.  \ref{fig:rms_ABB1}, \ref{fig:rms} present the RMSE between the
statistical model forecasts and the in-situ temperature observations
collected by the AUVs. These figures cover all experimental
configurations examined in this study.  Fig. \ref{fig:rms_ABB1},
corresponds to the initial phase of the experiments on the
29\textsuperscript{th} and the 30\textsuperscript{th}. Scenario
\textbf{A} represents the baseline statistical forecast based on CMS
data. \textbf{B} and \textbf{B1} scenarios correspond to forecasts for
the 30\textsuperscript{th} without and with the assimilation of
in-situ observations during the previous day (see Table
\ref{table:scenarios}). RMSE values in scenario \textbf{A} range from
approximately 0.48$^{\circ}$C near the surface to 1.33$^{\circ}$C at
40m, with a mean RMSE of about 0.74$^{\circ}$C. The errors increase
with depth, indicating reduced model skill in reproducing the
subsurface thermal structure.  The non-assimilated \textbf{B} scenario
remains similar to \textbf{A} in the upper layers but diverges below
20m. Assimilation in scenario \textbf{B1} consistently improves
predictions across the water column compared to the non-assimilated
\textbf{B} scenario with RMSE values between 0.31$^{\circ}$C and
0.55$^{\circ}$C and an average of 0.39$^{\circ}$C representing an
overall reduction of nearly 50\% relative to \textbf{B}. This
improvement is most pronounced in the 5–-20m layers, coinciding with
the strongest vertical temperature gradients and the region most
densely sampled by the AUVs.

The results for 31\textsuperscript{st} October, summarized in
Fig. \ref{fig:rms}, correspond to the phase of the experiment in which
multiple assimilation scenarios were tested. The \textbf{C}-series
used CMS data up to the 30\textsuperscript{th}, whereas the
\textbf{D}-series uses CMS up to the 29\textsuperscript{th},
representing a less favorable statistical initial state. In both
cases, the assimilation scenarios (\textbf{C1-–C4} and
\textbf{D1-–D4}) correspond to the incorporation of AUV data collected
during previous days (see Table \ref{table:scenarios}).

A consistent reduction in statistical forecast error is observed
across most vehicles and assimilation stages. In the
\textbf{C}-series, the average RMSE across all AUVs decreases from
approximately 0.40$^{\circ}$C in \textbf{C} to 0.31$^{\circ}$C in
\textbf{C4}, while in the \textbf{D}-series, the mean RMSE drops from
0.55$^{\circ}$C in \textbf{D} to 0.40$^{\circ}$C in \textbf{D4} (see
Table \ref{table:scenarios}). These improvements correspond to an
average error reduction of 25–-30\%, demonstrating that the
assimilation of targeted observations can compensate for differences
in the initial state and improve predictive accuracy.

For XP3 and XP5, which performed targeted sampling in the same area
where previous assimilation data were collected, RMSE values show a
consistent reduction. In contrast, XP2, which on the
31\textsuperscript{st} performed a cross-shore transect outside the
main target region, exhibits a weaker response to assimilation. The
implications of this behavior and its relevance for evaluating the
predictive robustness of the framework are examined in the Section
\ref{sec:disc}.  Vertically, RMSE profiles show similar behavior in
both experiment sets: errors tend to increase gradually below 25–-30m,
where model uncertainty and unresolved variability are
higher. However, this gradient weakens considerably in the fully
assimilated cases (\textbf{C4} and \textbf{D4}), particularly in the
upper 30m, where the assimilation of prior AUV data significantly
improves the representation of the temperature structure and
short-term thermal evolution probably associated with the
upwelling–-relaxation transition.
