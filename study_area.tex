The study was conducted in the coastal ocean off central Portugal,
focusing on the region influenced by the \naz Canyon (39.2$^{\circ}$
- 39.9$^{\circ}$N) (Fig. \ref{fig:studyarea-1}) during fall of
2024. While the experiment considered the measurable impact of model-driven robotic sampling to both the bio-geochemistry of the canyon
region, this manuscript is focused on the implications of closing the
\emph{sample-assimilate-predict-direct} loop closure.

Implementing such a closed-loop system in a dynamic coastal environment presents substantial challenges. These included the need for high-resolution numerical models capable of rapidly generating uncertainty projections, robust algorithms for exploration under a range of constraints, reliable communication links for mission updates, and assimilation frameworks that integrate heterogeneous real-time data streams. Furthermore, marine operations face logistical risks and communication limitations — such as low bandwidth, intermittent connectivity, and unpredictable weather — that further constrain the execution of adaptive sampling missions.

The \naz area features pronounced topographic contrasts: the
transition from the wide Estremadura Plateau to the narrower northern shelf, the long and narrow \naz submarine canyon that incises the
shelf and extends more than 200km offshore, and the Berlengas
archipelago, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve with high ecological
value. These features contribute to enhanced biological productivity
and biodiversity, and strongly modulate physical and biogeochemical
processes in the region.

Freshwater inputs from major rivers, such as the Tagus, have only a
limited direct impact on the area. In contrast, smaller rivers and the
\'{O}bidos lagoon can episodically deliver low-salinity, nutrient-rich
plumes to the shelf. Circulation is driven by seasonal wind
forcing linked with the Azores High, with persistent
upwelling-favorable northerly winds in summer and frequent downwelling
episodes in winter under southerly winds. The interplay between canyon
topography, shelf circulation, and atmospheric forcing generates
complex mesoscale dynamics, intensified tidal currents, and internal
wave activity that promote strong vertical mixing and cross-shelf
exchanges \cite{martins10,quaresma07}.

The combination of sharp bathymetric gradients, variable forcing, and
rich physical–biogeochemical interactions makes the \naz Canyon region
an ideal natural laboratory to test adaptive observation
strategies. In particular, its dynamic environment posed both
opportunities and challenges for the \proj experiment, providing a
representative coastal setting in which to evaluate how model-based
uncertainty projections can guide adaptive sampling and assimilation
to improve ocean model predictive skill.
