\subsection{Abstract}

This inter-disciplinary work demonstrates the viability of coupling
ocean models with in situ robotic sampling in a dynamic coastal region
as a mean to increase model skill and prediction. Model-driven
exploration closes the \emph{sample-assimilate-predict-direct} loop
within a virtuous cycle to refine prediction for a range of
applications in a region characterized by harsh conditions, high
variability, and diverse physical forcings, including bathymetry and
coastal topography.  By exploring the feasibility of coupling high
resolution AUV sampling and data assimilation with a geostatistical
model in a continuous loop, we aim to provide a new approach to
understanding coastal dynamics and processes, while using modest
computational resources.
