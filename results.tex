\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section presents the main results of the \proj experiment,
focusing on the integration of model forecasts, sampling, and data
assimilation using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The analysis
combines CMS and statistical model forecasts with in situ observations
to assess how the proposed data-cycle approach can enhance short-term
ocean prediction in a dynamic coastal environment.

Fig. \ref{fig:sst} provides an overview of the environmental
conditions observed during the three-day experimental window
considered in this study
(29\textsuperscript{th}–-31\textsuperscript{st} October). The
background fields correspond to the Level-3 Sea Surface Temperature
(SST) product from CMS. The operational area was compact, covering
approximately 100 km\textsuperscript{2} south of the \naz Canyon,
where the AUVs executed the sampling missions. All missions were
planned using the sampling algorithm to explore the temperature
variability predicted by the statistical model. On
31\textsuperscript{st} October, however, XP2 performed a different
mission, following a cross-shore transect of approximately 13 km
instead of a target-driven pattern north of the canyon. This mission
was designed to sample an internal wave hotspot, but, for the purpose
of this study, it serves as an independent ground-truth dataset,
collected in a distinct subregion relative to where the data
assimilation was applied. The XP2 observations are thus used as a
reference for evaluating the forecast cases (C–C4 and D–D4).

During this period, the coastal ocean was influenced by a late-season
upwelling–relaxation cycle. At the beginning of the sequence
(29\textsuperscript{th} October), the SST field reveals the
characteristic signature of coastal upwelling, with colder water
masses extending offshore due to wind-driven Ekman transport that
brings subsurface, nutrient-rich waters to the surface. In the
following days (30\textsuperscript{th}-–31\textsuperscript{st}
October), the weakening of upwelling-favorable winds led to a
relaxation phase, during which warmer offshore waters gradually
advanced toward the coast. This transition is reflected in the SST
maps by an overall warming trend in the nearshore region, particularly
evident on 1\textsuperscript{st} November.

It is important to note that the SST imagery is partially affected by
cloud coverage, which limits the availability and accuracy of
satellite-derived temperature data. These gaps arise from the
radiometric constraints of indirect SST retrieval, resulting in reduced
spatial continuity and increased uncertainty near cloudy regions.
Despite these limitations, the SST patterns clearly capture the dominant
mesoscale features and coastal processes driving the observed
variability during the experiment.

These evolving conditions provided an ideal natural setting for
testing the adaptive sampling and data assimilation framework
developed in \proje. The pronounced temperature gradients associated
with the upwelling front generated well-defined spatial and temporal
variability, allowing the evaluation of how AUV-based targeted
observations can improve the predictive skill of the statistical model
in a real-world coastal scenario.

Following the overview of the surface conditions,
Fig.\ref{fig:temperatureprofiles} presents the vertical temperature
distribution recorded by the AUVs XP2, XP3, and XP5 during their
respective missions between 29\textsuperscript{th} and
31\textsuperscript{st} October. The panels show temperature as a
function of time and depth, illustrating the temporal and vertical
structure of the coastal water column throughout the three-day
experimental sequence.

XP2 operated on 29\textsuperscript{th} October, XP5 on
29\textsuperscript{th}, 30\textsuperscript{th}, and
31\textsuperscript{st} October, and XP3 on 30\textsuperscript{th} and
31\textsuperscript{st} October, with all vehicles capable of sampling
the upper 100 m of the water column. However, this depth range was not
always achieved due to logistical and bathymetric constraints. The
temperature fields reveal a thermocline and a progressive warming of
the surface layer down to approximately 40 m depth, with temperatures
ranging from around 14 $^{\circ}$C in deeper layers to about 18
$^{\circ}$C near the surface, reaching their maximum on
30\textsuperscript{th} October afternoon during XP5’s mission.

It is important to note that the trajectories shown in the previous
figure might suggest that the AUVs remained continuously at sea for 24
hours each day. However, as Fig. \ref{fig:temperatureprofiles}
demonstrates, this was not the case. The vehicles can be deployed and
recovered multiple times per day, with operational windows limited by
logistics, weather, and available support assets. This figure,
therefore, also highlights the non-linear nature of field logistics in
multi-vehicle operations, where dynamic scheduling, resource allocation,
and environmental constraints determine the actual temporal coverage of
the missions.

The following section summarizes the quantitative evaluation of the
model’s predictive performance across all tested scenarios. Fig.
\ref{fig:rms_ABB1}, \ref{fig:rms_c}, and \ref{fig:rms_d} present the
RMSE between the statistical model forecasts and the in situ
temperature observations collected by the AUVs during the \proj
campaign. These tables cover all experimental configurations examined
in this study, providing a comprehensive overview of how the
assimilation of targeted AUV data affects the model’s short-term
forecast accuracy and vertical consistency.


The first set of results, summarized in Fig. \ref{fig:rms_ABB1},
corresponds to the initial phase of the \proj experiments on days
29\textsuperscript{th} and 30\textsuperscript{th} October. Scenario A
represents the baseline statiscal forecast produced based CMS
data. The B and B1 scenarios correspond to forecasts for
30\textsuperscript{th} October with and without the assimilation of
\textit{in situ} observations collected by XP2 during the previous
day, respectively.  Across the vertical profile, RMSE values in
scenario A range from approximately 0.48 $^{\circ}$C near the surface
to 1.33 $^{\circ}$C at 40 m, with a mean RMSE of about 0.74
$^{\circ}$C. The errors increase with depth, indicating reduced model
skill in reproducing the subsurface thermal structure.  The
non-assimilated B scenario remains similar to A in the upper layers
but diverges below 20 m, confirming that the assimilation of recent
AUV data substantially improves the short-term forecast skill and
internal consistency of the model.  After assimilation, the B1 case
shows a consistent improvement throughout the column compared to the
non-assimilated B scenario, with RMSE values between 0.31 $^{\circ}$C
and 0.55 $^{\circ}$C and an average of 0.39 $^{\circ}$C, representing
an overall reduction of nearly 50\% relative to B. This improvement is
most pronounced in the 5–-20 m layer, coinciding with the strongest
vertical temperature gradients and the region most densely sampled by
the AUVs.

    on CMS data up to 29\textsuperscript{th} October. Scenarios B and
    B1 represent forecasts for 30\textsuperscript{th} October without
    and with the assimilation of AUV observations collected by XP2,
    respectively. Values are shown for each depth level sampled during
    the missions.}

\end{wrapfigure}


The results for 31\textsuperscript{st} October, summarized in
Figs. \ref{fig:rms_c} and \ref{fig:rms_d}, correspond to the most
comprehensive phase of the experiment, in which multiple assimilation
scenarios were tested. The C-series uses CMS data up to
30\textsuperscript{th} October, whereas the D-series starts from CMS
data up to 29\textsuperscript{th} October, representing a less
favorable statistical initial state. In both cases, the assimilation
scenarios (C1–C4 and D1–D4) correspond to the incorporation of AUVs
temperature data collected during the previous days by XP2, XP3, and
XP5.

A consistent reduction in statistical forecast error is observed
across most vehicles and assimilation stages. In the C-series, the
average RMSE across all AUVs decreases from approximately 0.40
$^{\circ}$C in C to 0.31 $^{\circ}$C in C4, while in the D-series, the
mean RMSE drops from 0.55 $^{\circ}$C in D to 0.40 $^{\circ}$C in
D4. These improvements correspond to an average error reduction of
25–30\%, demonstrating that the assimilation of targeted observations
can compensate for differences in the initial state and improve
predictive accuracy.

It should be noted, however, that the improvement is not uniform
across all vehicles. For XP3 and XP5, which performed target-sampling
missions in the same area where previous assimilation data were
collected, RMSE values show a clear reduction. In contrast, XP2, which
on 31\textsuperscript{st} October performed an independent cross-shore
transect outside the main target region, exhibits a weaker response to
assimilation. The implications of this behavior and its relevance for
evaluating the predictive robustness of the framework will be further
examined in the Discussion section.  Vertically, RMSE profiles show
similar behavior in both experiment sets: errors tend to increase
gradually below 25–30 m, where model uncertainty and unresolved
variability are higher. However, this gradient weakens considerably in
the fully assimilated cases (C4 and D4), particularly in the upper 30
m, where the assimilation of prior AUV data significantly improves the
representation of the temperature structure and short-term thermal
evolution probably associated with the upwelling–relaxation
transition.

\end{figure}

To further interpret the RMSE results presented in the previous table,
Fig. \ref{fig:scatter} focuses on the most contrasted scenarios: the
baseline cases without assimilation (C and D) and those incorporating
the full set of AUV observations from previous days (C4 and D4). This
comparison highlights the point-wise behaviour of the statistical
model under minimum and maximum assimilation influence.

The four scatter plots compares the temperature values acquired in
situ by the AUVs on 31\textsuperscript{st} October against the
corresponding geostatistical predictions derived from the statistical
model under each scenario. The observations include all available
measurements collected along the missions of XP2, XP3, and XP5 on that
day (see Fig. \ref{fig:sst} and \ref{fig:temperatureprofiles}. Colors
indicate the depth layers associated with the vertical discretization
used in the deterministic CMS model, which defines the vertical
structure of the statistical model.

In the baseline scenarios without assimilation (C and D), the scatter
plots exhibit a wide spread of points around the reference line,
indicating substantial discrepancies between the model predictions and
the observed AUV temperatures. These deviations are particularly
evident in ..., where surface temperatures tend to be
overestimated. This dispersion reflects the model’s limited ability to
accurately reproduce the vertical thermal structure when it relies
solely on CMS data without incorporating recent in situ information.

In contrast, the fully assimilated scenarios (C4 and D4) show a much
tighter clustering of points around reference, especially within the
upper layers, where the previous AUV missions had provided dense and
temporally relevant observations. This reduction in spread suggests a
clear improvement in predictive accuracy, indicating that the
assimilation of targeted measurements effectively constrains the
thermal structure and captures ongoing physical transitions in the
water column.
