\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}

% In this section we analyze the results with the combination of CMS
% data, the statistical model forecasts and in-situ observations to
% assess the impact to short-term ocean prediction in a dynamic coastal
% environment like \naze.

Fig. \ref{fig:sst} provides an overview of the environmental
conditions observed during the three-day experimental window
considered in this study. The background fields correspond to the
Level-3 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) product from CMS. The
operational area covers approximately 100 km\textsuperscript{2} south
of the \naz Canyon.  While all missions pivot around the exploration
of temperature variability predicted by the model, on
31\textsuperscript{st} October, XP2 was deployed for a cross-shore
transect of approximately 13 km to sample an internal wave hotspot;
for the purpose of this study, it serves as an independent
ground-truth dataset. These observations are used as a reference for
evaluating the forecast cases \textbf{C1-–C4} and \textbf{D1–-D4}.

During the experimentation, the coastal ocean was influenced by a
late-season upwelling-relaxation cycle. At the beginning of the
sequence (29\textsuperscript{th} October), the SST field reveals the
characteristic signature of coastal upwelling, with colder water
masses extending offshore due to wind-driven Ekman transport that
brings subsurface, nutrient-rich waters to the surface. In the
following days, the weakening of upwelling-favorable winds led to a
relaxation phase, during which warmer offshore waters gradually
advanced toward the coast. This transition is reflected in the SST
maps by an overall warming trend in the nearshore region, particularly
evident November 1\textsuperscript{st} (Fig. \ref{fig:sst}).

It is important to note that the SST imagery is partially affected by
cloud coverage, which limits the availability and accuracy of
satellite-derived temperature data. These gaps arise from the
radiometric constraints of indirect SST retrieval, resulting in
reduced spatial continuity and increased uncertainty near cloudy
regions.  Despite these limitations, the SST patterns clearly capture
the dominant mesoscale features and coastal processes driving the
observed variability during the experiment.  The pronounced
temperature gradients associated with the upwelling front generated
well-defined spatial and temporal variability, allowing the evaluation
of how targeted in-situ observations can improve the predictive skill
of the statistical model in a coastal environment.

Fig.\ref{fig:temperatureprofiles} shows the vertical temperature
distribution recorded by the AUVs during their respective missions
between 29\textsuperscript{th} and 31\textsuperscript{st} October. The
panels illustrate the temporal and vertical structure of the coastal
water column throughout the three-day experimental sequence, as well
as highlighting the non-linear nature of field logistics in
multi-vehicle operations, where dynamic scheduling, resource
allocation, and environmental constraints determine the actual
temporal coverage of the vehicle deployments.

XP2 operated on the 29\textsuperscript{th}, XP5 on the
29\textsuperscript{th}, 30\textsuperscript{th}, and
31\textsuperscript{st}, and XP3 on 30\textsuperscript{th} and
31\textsuperscript{st} October.  The temperature fields reveal a
thermocline and a progressive warming of the surface layer down to
approximately 40m depth, with temperatures ranging from around
14$^{\circ}$C in deeper layers to about 18$^{\circ}$C near the
surface, reaching their maximum on the 30\textsuperscript{th}
afternoon during XP5’s mission.
% It is important to note that the trajectories shown in the previous
% figure might suggest that the AUVs remained continuously at sea for 24
% hours each day. However, as Fig. \ref{fig:temperatureprofiles}
% demonstrates, this was not the case. The vehicles can be deployed and
% recovered multiple times per day, with operational windows limited by

    \textbf{A} corresponds to the baseline statistical forecast
    generated based on CMS data up to the
    29\textsuperscript{th}. Scenarios \textbf{B} and \textbf{B1}

    respectively. Values are shown for each depth level sampled.}

\end{wrapfigure}

Fig. \ref{fig:rms_ABB1}, corresponds to the initial phase of the
experiments on the 29\textsuperscript{th} and the
30\textsuperscript{th}. Scenario \textbf{A} represents the baseline
statistical forecast based on CMS data. The \textbf{B} and \textbf{B1}
scenarios correspond to forecasts for the 30\textsuperscript{th}
without and with the assimilation of in-situ observations during the
previous day.  Across the vertical profile, RMSE values in scenario
\textbf{A} range from approximately 0.48$^{\circ}$C near the surface
to 1.33$^{\circ}$C at 40m, with a mean RMSE of about
0.74$^{\circ}$C. The errors increase with depth, indicating reduced
model skill in reproducing the subsurface thermal structure.  The
non-assimilated \textbf{B} scenario remains similar to \textbf{A} in
the upper layers but diverges below 20m. After assimilation, the
\textbf{B1} case shows a consistent improvement throughout the water
column compared to the non-assimilated \textbf{B} scenario, with RMSE
values between 0.31$^{\circ}$C and 0.55$^{\circ}$C and an average of
0.39$^{\circ}$C representing an overall reduction of nearly 50\%
relative to \textbf{B}. This improvement is most pronounced in the
5–-20m layers, coinciding with the strongest vertical temperature
gradients and the region most densely sampled by the
AUVs.

The results for 31\textsuperscript{st} October, summarized in
Fig. \ref{fig:rms}, correspond to the phase of the experiment in which
multiple assimilation scenarios were tested. The \textbf{C}-series
used CMS data up to 30\textsuperscript{th} October, whereas the
\textbf{D}-series uses CMS up to 29\textsuperscript{th} October,
representing a less favorable statistical initial state. In both
cases, the assimilation scenarios (\textbf{C1-–C4} and
\textbf{D1-–D4}) correspond to the incorporation of AUV data collected
during the previous days.

A consistent reduction in statistical forecast error is observed
across most vehicles and assimilation stages. In the
\textbf{C}-series, the average RMSE across all AUVs decreases from
approximately 0.40$^{\circ}$C in \textbf{C} to 0.31$^{\circ}$C in
\textbf{C4}, while in the \textbf{D}-series, the mean RMSE drops from
0.55$^{\circ}$C in \textbf{D} to 0.40$^{\circ}$C in
\textbf{D4}. These improvements correspond to an average error
reduction of 25–-30\%, demonstrating that the assimilation of targeted
observations can compensate for differences in the initial state and
improve predictive accuracy.

For XP3 and XP5, which performed targeted sampling in the same area
where previous assimilation data were collected, RMSE values show a
consistent reduction. In contrast, XP2, which on the
31\textsuperscript{st} performed a cross-shore transect outside the
main target region, exhibits a weaker response to assimilation. The
implications of this behavior and its relevance for evaluating the
predictive robustness of the framework are examined in the Section
\ref{sec:disc}.  Vertically, RMSE profiles show similar behavior in
both experiment sets: errors tend to increase gradually below 25–30m,
where model uncertainty and unresolved variability are
higher. However, this gradient weakens considerably in the fully
assimilated cases (\textbf{C4} and \textbf{D4}), particularly in the
upper 30m, where the assimilation of prior AUV data significantly
improves the representation of the temperature structure and
short-term thermal evolution probably associated with the
upwelling–-relaxation transition.

In Fig. \ref{fig:scatter}, four scatter plots compare the measurements
acquired in-situ on 31\textsuperscript{st} October against the
corresponding geostatistical predictions derived under each
scenario. They focus on the most contrasted scenarios: the baseline
cases without assimilation (\textbf{C} and \textbf{D}) and those
incorporating the full set of AUV observations from previous days
(\textbf{C4} and \textbf{D4}). The observations include all available
measurements collected along the missions on that day (see
Fig. \ref{fig:sst} and \ref{fig:temperatureprofiles}. Colors indicate
the depth layers associated with the vertical discretization used in
the deterministic CMS model which defines the vertical structure of
the statistical model.  This comparison illustrates the model's
ability to reproduce the observed temperatures at each measurement
point accurately, contrasting the non-assimilated cases (\textbf{C}
and \textbf{D}) with the partially and fully assimilated
(\textbf{C1-4} and \textbf{D1-4}).

In the baseline scenarios without assimilation (\textbf{C} and
\textbf{D}), the plots exhibit a wide spread of points around the
reference line, indicating substantial discrepancies between the model
predictions and the observed AUV measurements. These deviations are
particularly evident in XP3 and XP5 data, where temperatures around
20-30 m depth tend to be overestimated by almost 1$^{\circ}$C)
(Figs. \ref{fig:rms_c} and \ref{fig:rms_d}). This dispersion reflects
the model’s limited ability to accurately reproduce the vertical
thermal structure when it relies solely on CMS data without
incorporating in-situ information.

In contrast, the fully assimilated scenarios (\textbf{C4} and
\textbf{D4}) show a much tighter clustering of points around the
reference, especially within the studied upper layers, where the previous AUV
missions provide dense and temporally relevant observations. This
reduction in spread suggests a clear improvement in predictive
accuracy, indicating that the assimilation of targeted measurements
effectively constrains the thermal structure and captures ongoing
physical transitions in the water column.
