\subsection{Abstract}

This inter-disciplinary work demonstrates the viability of coupling
ocean models with in situ robotic sampling in the context of a dynamic
coastal region as a means to increase model skill and
prediction. Model-driven exploration closes the
\emph{sample-assimilate-predict-direct} loop within a virtuous cycle
to refine prediction for a range of applications in a region which is
often harsh, has high variability and interacts with a range of
physical forcings including the bathymetry and coastal topography.  By
exploring the feasibility of coupling high resolution AUV sampling and
data assimilation with a geostatistical model in a continuous loop, we
aim to provide a new approach to understanding coastal dynamics and
processes, while using modest computational resources.
