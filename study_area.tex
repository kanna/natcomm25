The study was conducted in the coastal ocean off central Portugal,
focusing on the region influenced by the \naz Canyon (39.2$^{\circ}$
-39.9$^{\circ}$N) (Fig. \ref{fig:studyarea-1}) in the Fall of
2024. While the experiment considered the measurable impact of model
driven robotic sampling to both the bio-geochemistry of the the canyon
region, this manuscript is focused on the implications of such
\emph{sample-assimilate-predict-direct} loop closure
(Fig. \ref{fig:loop-closure}).

Implementing such a system in the dynamic real world of the coastal
region presents substantial challenges requiring high-resolution
numerical models capable of rapidly generating uncertainty
projections, robust algorithms for exploration under a range of
constraints, reliable communication links for mission updates, and
assimilation frameworks able to integrate heterogeneous, real-time
data streams. Furthermore, the logistical risks and communication
limitations inherent in marine operations — low bandwidth,
intermittent connections, unpredictable weather conditions — impose
additional constraints on the practical execution of adaptive sampling
missions.

The \naz area is shaped by strong topographic contrasts, including the
transition from the wide Estremadura Plateau to the narrower shelf to
the north, the long and narrow \naz submarine canyon that incises the
shelf and extends more than 200 km offshore, and the Berlengas
archipelago, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve with high ecological
value. These features contribute to enhanced biological productivity
and biodiversity, and strongly modulate physical and biogeochemical
processes in the region.

Freshwater inputs from major rivers, such as the Tagus, have only a
limited direct impact on the area. In contrast, smaller rivers and the
\'{O}bidos lagoon can episodically deliver low-salinity, nutrient-rich
plumes to the shelf. Circulation is controlled by seasonal wind
forcing associated with the Azores High, with persistent
upwelling-favorable northerly winds in summer and frequent downwelling
episodes in winter under southerly winds. The interplay between canyon
topography, shelf circulation, and atmospheric forcing generates
complex mesoscale dynamics, intensified tidal currents, and internal
wave activity that promote strong vertical mixing and cross-shelf
exchanges \cite{martins10,quaresma07}.

The combination of sharp bathymetric gradients, variable forcing, and
rich physical–biogeochemical interactions makes the \naz Canyon region
an ideal natural laboratory to test adaptive observation
strategies. In particular, its dynamic environment posed both
opportunities and challenges for the \proj experiment, providing a
representative coastal setting in which to evaluate how model-based
uncertainty projections can guide adaptive sampling and assimilation
to improve ocean model predictive skill.
