\section{introduction}

\textit{\textbf{-	Set the context and background of your study.}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fresnel proposal context
\item Data cycle idea
\item Model predictions and uncertainties -$>$ Improve quality of Data gathering -$>$ data assimilation into models -$>$ better model predictions
\item Point out the logistics difficulties of doing this in the sea (low bandwidth comms, risks, computing time, etc)
\end{itemize}

\textit{-	\textbf{Clearly state the objective and significance of your research.}}
\begin{itemize}
\item real-world experiment to close the data loop between better efficiency to get data to improve the Improved Ocean Model Predictions\
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item present a figure showing that idea of loop/cycle
\end{itemize}
